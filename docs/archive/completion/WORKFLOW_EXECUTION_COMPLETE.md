## Impact

✓ **Critical for Round 2** - Workflow execution is now complete
- Users can execute detected workflows with one click
- Real-time progress tracking provides transparency
- Execution history enables audit and review
- Stop functionality provides safety and control

## Next Priority

Remaining incomplete tasks (4% to reach 100%):
- **Task 6.3**: Session management functionality (privacy controls)
- **Task 8.3**: Debug console log filtering
- **Task 9.1-9.2**: Responsive layout improvements
- **Task 10.1, 10.3**: Performance optimizations
- **Task 11.1**: Final accessibility audit

The most impactful next task would be **Task 6.3 (Session Management)** to complete the privacy controls functionality.
